## Ready for Beta Testing

The EDEM Mirror system is now ready for the initial phase of beta testing with 5-10 users. The core functionality has been implemented and tested, including:

1. Multi-level dialogue system (Shadow → Truth → Integration)
2. RAG-based context-aware responses
3. Automated check-in and practice tracking
4. Safety system with crisis intervention
5. Comprehensive analytics tracking

## Key Metrics Ready for Tracking

All the key metrics identified in the launch plan are now ready to be tracked:

- Daily/Monthly Active Users (DAU/MAU)
- Session duration and completion rates
- Stage progression patterns
- Practice completion rates
- Check-in frequency
- Safety incident detection rates

The system is prepared for the next phase of the launch plan where we'll recruit beta testers and begin gathering real user feedback.
