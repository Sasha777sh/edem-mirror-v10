# Access Control System Implementation

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of the access control system for the EDEM Living LLM project, based on the architectural guidance provided.

## Components Implemented

### 1. Access Control Logic (`src/lib/access.ts`)

- Defined Role and Feature types
- Created access matrix mapping features to required roles
- Implemented `hasAccess()` function for permission checking
- Implemented `normalizeFeature()` function for input validation

### 2. Server Authentication (`src/lib/server/auth.ts`)

- Created `getUserAndRole()` function to retrieve user session and role
- Integrated with Supabase authentication system
- Handles public users with default 'public' role

### 3. Server Guard (`src/lib/server/guard.ts`)

- Implemented `withAccess()` higher-order function
- Provides middleware protection for API routes
- Returns graceful fallback responses for unauthorized access

### 4. API Route Protection (`src/app/api/edem-living-llm/route.ts`)

- Updated POST endpoint to use access control
- Maps access features to EDEM stages (light → integration, truth → truth, shadow → shadow)
- Implements soft fallback to safe mode for unauthorized access

### 5. Client Component Protection (`src/components/FeatureGate.tsx`)

- Created reusable React component for UI-level access control
- Conditionally renders children based on user role and feature access
- Supports fallback UI for unauthorized access

### 6. Database Migration (`src/migrations/004_roles.sql`)

- Created SQL migration for adding roles to profiles table
- Defined user_role enum type
- Added role column with default 'public' value
- Implemented Row Level Security policies

### 7. Role Promotion Script (`scripts/promoteGuardian.ts`)

- Created script for promoting users to guardian role
- Uses Supabase service role key for administrative access
- Added npm script command: `npm run promote:guardian`

### 8. Disclaimer Component (`src/components/Disclaimer.tsx`)

- Created component with safety disclaimers
- Implemented "Me poorly" modal with emergency contacts
- Added to UI for ethical safety measures

### 9. Documentation (`docs/ACCESS_CONTROL.md`)

- Created comprehensive documentation for the access control system
- Explains implementation details, security considerations, and ethical guidelines

### 10. Unit Tests (`__tests__/access-control.test.ts`)

- Created tests for access control logic
- Validates role-based permissions
- Tests feature normalization

### 11. Example Implementation (`src/components/ChatInterfaceExample.tsx`)

- Created example chat interface showing access control in practice
- Demonstrates FeatureGate usage in UI components

## Key Features

1. **Three-tier access system** (public → registered → guardian)
2. **Soft fallback behavior** - Unauthorized users get safe responses instead of errors
3. **Server and client protection** - Defense in depth approach
4. **Ethical safety measures** - Disclaimers and emergency contacts
5. **Administrative tools** - Scripts for role management
6. **Comprehensive testing** - Unit tests for core logic
7. **Documentation** - Clear explanation of the system

## Integration Points

The access control system integrates with:

- Supabase authentication and database
- Next.js API routes and middleware
- React component rendering
- Database schema and migrations
- Administrative scripts

## Security Considerations

1. Server-side checks are authoritative
2. Client-side checks are for UX optimization
3. Role updates require service role keys
4. Row Level Security policies protect data access
5. Soft fallback prevents information disclosure

This implementation provides a robust, ethically-grounded access control system that aligns with the spiritual journey concept of the EDEM Living LLM platform.
