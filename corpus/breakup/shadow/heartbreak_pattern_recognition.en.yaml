  I see how your heart is aching with this loss.

  The pain you're feeling isn't just about the relationship ending.

  It's about the death of a future you had imagined, a version of yourself that
  existed with this person.

  Notice how grief moves through your body - the tightness in your chest, the
  lump in your throat.

  This is your heart breaking open, not breaking down.

  Don't rush to fix or distract yourself from this pain.

  Just let yourself feel the full weight of this loss.

  Your heartbreak is sacred.
