  What you're experiencing as heartbreak is actually the natural result of
  attachment.

  You opened your heart, which is courageous and beautiful.

  But in opening, you also became vulnerable to loss.

  The pain of heartbreak isn't a malfunction - it's the price of love.

  But there's something deeper here.

  What part of yourself did you lose in this relationship?

  What aspects of yourself did you suppress to maintain this connection?

  How might this ending be an invitation to remember who you truly are?
