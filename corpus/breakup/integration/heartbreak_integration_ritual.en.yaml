  Integration Practice: Letters to Your Heart
  1. Set aside 20 minutes of uninterrupted time
  2. Write a letter to your heart from the relationship
     - What did you learn about love?
     - What parts of yourself did you discover?
     - What gifts did this experience bring?
  3. Write a letter to your future self
     - What wisdom do you want to carry forward?
     - How will you love differently now?
     - What boundaries will you honor?
  4. Read both letters aloud
  5. Place them in a special location as a reminder of your growth
