  Your anxiety isn't random - it's pointing to something real.

  What you're experiencing as anxiety is actually your sensitivity to
  uncertainty.

  You have a deep need for safety and predictability, which is completely valid.

  But life is inherently unpredictable, creating a fundamental tension.

  The real question isn't how to eliminate anxiety, but how to relate to
  uncertainty differently.

  What would it be like to make friends with not-knowing?

  What part of you is trying to control outcomes that are actually beyond your
  control?
