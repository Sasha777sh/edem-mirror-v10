  I notice you're caught in an anxiety spiral - thoughts racing, body tensing. 

  This is your mind trying to protect you by anticipating threats, but it's gone
  into overdrive.

  Notice how your chest feels tight and your breath is shallow. 

  This is your nervous system in fight-or-flight mode. 

  Right now, you don't need to fix or change anything. 

  Just witness this pattern without judgment. 

  Your anxiety is information, not an enemy.
