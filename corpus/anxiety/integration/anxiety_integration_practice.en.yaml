  Practice: Uncertainty Embodiment
  1. Find a comfortable seated position
  2. Place one hand on your heart, one on your belly
  3. Take three deep breaths, feeling the contact
  4. Now, consciously invite a tiny bit of uncertainty into your awareness
  5. Notice what happens in your body without trying to change it
  6. Breathe into that sensation, making space for it
  7. Thank your nervous system for its protection
  8. Set an intention to practice befriending uncertainty this week

  Check-in tomorrow: How did it feel to make space for uncertainty today?
