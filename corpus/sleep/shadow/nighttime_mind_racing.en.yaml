  I notice your mind is racing as you try to sleep.

  Thoughts are cycling through - worries, to-do lists, conversations.

  Your nervous system is in overdrive, making it hard to rest.

  This isn't your fault or a personal failing.

  Your mind is trying to solve problems and process the day.

  But right now, it's 3 AM, not problem-solving time.

  Notice the pattern without judgment.

  Your racing thoughts are trying to help, even if they're not helping you
  sleep.
