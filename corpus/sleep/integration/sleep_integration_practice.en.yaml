  Integration Practice: Evening Transition Ritual
  1. One hour before bed, begin your transition
  2. Dim the lights and put away screens
  3. Do a body scan from feet to head
  4. Notice three things you're grateful for from today
  5. Write down tomorrow's top 3 priorities (not 20!)
  6. Place your hands on your heart and say:
     "I did my best today. I am safe. I can rest."
  7. Set a gentle alarm for tomorrow with a meaningful intention

  Check-in tomorrow morning: How did your transition ritual support rest?
