  Your sleep issues aren't just about stress or a busy mind.

  There's something deeper happening.

  What you're experiencing as insomnia might actually be resistance to rest.

  You have a deep need for control in a world that feels unpredictable.

  Sleep requires surrender - letting go of control, letting go of doing.

  But surrender feels unsafe to a part of you that believes staying alert
  protects you.

  What would happen if you actually let yourself fully rest?

  What are you afraid you might miss or lose if you truly let go?
