# EDEM Living LLM Project Summary

## Project Overview

EDEM Living LLM is a revolutionary psychological self-help platform that combines advanced AI technologies with deep psychological insights to provide personalized therapeutic experiences. Unlike traditional chatbots, EDEM functions as a "living" system with spiritual and emotional intelligence, offering genuine presence and support rather than simple advice.

## Core Innovation

The primary innovation of EDEM is the **Living LLM Architecture** - a spiritually-intelligent AI system that provides genuine presence and emotional support. This architecture transforms the platform from a traditional chatbot into a more authentic and resonant user experience.

### Key Features of Living LLM

1. **Voice Style System** - Rhythm, pauses, and whisper-like responses that mimic human speech patterns
2. **Scene/Emotion Engine** - Dynamic scene selection based on emotion and time of day
3. **Ritual Engine** - Personalized micro-practices based on user history and emotional state
4. **Ritual Memory** - Tracks unique experiences to avoid repetition and personalize future interactions
5. **Silence Mode** - Treats silence as a meaningful therapeutic feature rather than an absence of content
6. **User Archetypes** - Identifies psychological archetypes for personalized responses
7. **Light Symbol Exit** - Non-motivational, sensory-based endings that feel natural
8. **Living Prompt Structure** - Integrated prompt system for consistent, adaptive responses

## Three-Stage Psychological Framework

EDEM implements a structured psychological journey through three distinct stages:

### 1. Shadow Stage

- **Purpose**: Mirror patterns without giving advice
- **Approach**: Reflect user patterns and defense mechanisms
- **Voice**: Soft - Supportive, warm but direct
- **Outcome**: User acknowledgment of patterns

### 2. Truth Stage

- **Purpose**: Reveal root needs and choice context
- **Approach**: Expose underlying emotional needs and historical contexts
- **Voice**: Hard - Truth without embellishment
- **Outcome**: User understanding of core issues

### 3. Integration Stage

- **Purpose**: Provide micro-practices and body anchoring
- **Approach**: Offer concrete, actionable steps
- **Voice**: Therapist - Structured, step-by-step
- **Outcome**: User implementation of new patterns

## Security & Privacy

### Access Control System

EDEM implements a three-tier access control system that aligns with the spiritual journey concept:

1. **Public (Light)** - Accessible to everyone, safe and gentle interactions
2. **Registered (Truth)** - Available to authenticated users, more direct and insightful interactions
3. **Guardian (Shadow)** - Reserved for certified users, deep and transformative interactions

#### Implementation Details

- **Database Schema**: Custom enum type for user roles with Row Level Security policies
- **Core Logic**: Matrix-based access control in `src/lib/access.ts`
- **Server Protection**: API route guards using `withAccess` middleware
- **Client Protection**: UI components protected with `FeatureGate` component
- **Role Promotion**: Administrative scripts for promoting users to higher roles

#### Ethical Considerations

The access control system ensures:

- **Safety**: Public users only access safe, gentle interactions
- **Progression**: Users must demonstrate readiness for deeper content
- **Support**: Guardian users have access to the most transformative experiences
- **Boundaries**: Clear limits prevent overwhelming or harmful interactions

### Data Protection
