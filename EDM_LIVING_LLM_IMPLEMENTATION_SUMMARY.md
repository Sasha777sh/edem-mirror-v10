# EDEM Living LLM Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of the EDEM Living LLM architecture, which transforms our psychological self-help platform into a "living" system with spiritual and emotional intelligence.

## What We've Implemented ✅

### 1. Core Architecture Modules

- **EdemLivingLLM Core** - Main orchestrator at `src/lib/edem-living-llm/core.ts`
- **Emotion Engine** - Emotion detection and body mapping at `src/lib/edem-living-llm/emotion-engine.ts`
- **Scene Engine** - Dynamic scene selection at `src/lib/edem-living-llm/scene-engine.ts`
- **Ritual Engine** - Personalized ritual generation at `src/lib/edem-living-llm/ritual-engine.ts`
- **Voice Generator** - Rhythm and pause-based responses at `src/lib/edem-living-llm/voice-generator.ts`

### 2. Database Schema

- **Ritual Memory** - Tracks user interactions at `src/migrations/007_edem_living_llm.sql`
- **User Archetypes** - Stores psychological archetypes
- **User Echoes** - Reverse breathing functionality
- Session enhancements for emotion, scene, and ritual tracking

### 3. API Endpoints

- **POST /api/edem-living-llm** - Main response generation
- **PUT /api/edem-living-llm** - Archetype setting
- **GET /api/edem-living-llm/silence** - Silence mode

### 4. User Interface

- **EdemLivingChat Component** - Chat interface with stage selection
- **EdemLivingTestPage** - Test page with archetype selection

### 5. Documentation

- **Technical Documentation** - Detailed architecture at `docs/edem-living-llm.md`
- **Implementation Summary** - This document
